The '''Valea Viilor fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Valea Viilor}}; {{lang-de|Kirchenburg von Wurmloch}}) is a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] [[fortified church]] in [[Valea Viilor]] (''Wurmloch''), [[Sibiu County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by the [[Germans|ethnic German]] [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Initially [[Roman Catholic]], it became Lutheran following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the church forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==Description==
[[File:Valea Viilor - Biserica 02.jpg|thumb|Church interior]]

[[File:Valea Viilor Biserica fortificata (3).JPG|thumb|Altar]]

===Background and church===
There is evidence to suggest that an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church existed in the village, as remnants could formerly be seen beneath the floor of the [[sacristy]]. This building is believed to have been 10 m long, less than half the length of the present church. The latter, in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and dedicated to [[Saint Peter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dragut&quot;&gt;[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Arta gotică în România'', p.127. Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; was begun in the 14th century. The small [[nave]] has a vaulted ceiling with a complex network of ribs, which rest on seven pairs of poles attached to the walls. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] has a ceiling of the same type.&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;/&gt; Built in 1528, the [[pulpit]] was produced in a period of transition from Gothic to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;org&quot;/&gt;

The church underwent modifications at the beginning of the 16th century: a defensive level featuring parapets was added atop the nave, while towers were built next to the north and south entrances. Next to each of these was a small round tower with a spiral staircase that reached the fortified level. A third tower, near the buttress at the southwest end of the nave, provided access to the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]],&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;/&gt; itself fitted with numerous and varied defense mechanisms. The choir was rebuilt as a three-story brick defensive tower with walls 1.5 m thick. A fourth level, which juts out slightly atop a row of [[corbel]]s and is supported by arches built between the [[buttress]]es, has a [[Timber framing|timber frame]] [[parapet]]. The altar painting was executed in 1779 by an artist from [[Sighișoara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;org&quot;/&gt;

===Fortifications and recognition===
A single oval fortification,&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;/&gt; constructed around 1500 and equipped with a [[battlement]] resting on brick arches,&lt;ref name=&quot;org&quot;/&gt; surrounds the church. Access is through an arched passage beneath the [[gate tower]] on the western side. This could be closed with a [[portcullis]] that had a grille of wood strengthened by iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;&gt;{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/valea_viilor___wurmloch/19/ Valea Viilor/Wurmloch] at biserici-fortificate.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;org&quot;&gt;{{in lang|ro}} [http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/valea-viilor-wurmloch/ Valea Viilor/Wurmloch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504204639/http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/valea-viilor-wurmloch/ |date=2014-05-04 }} at biserici-fortificate.org&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[bastion]]s survive, each facing one of the [[cardinal points]]. The walls reach 6–7 m in height; they have both parapets and [[embrasure]]s supported by corbels.&lt;ref name=&quot;com&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, Valea Viilor, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 &quot;World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List&quot;] at the UNESCO site&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with the wall and bastions being listed as a separate entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20190217084918/http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_SB.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Sibiu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mathews Mr Easy''' is an [[United States|American]] [[homebuilt aircraft]] that was designed by Lyle Mathews and associates and produced by the [[Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Association]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]]. It was the sixth and final design of Mathews. The aircraft is supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot;&gt;Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition'', page 286. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. {{ISBN|0-9636409-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VULA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://vula.org/blueprint_pricelist.html|title = Blueprints Price List|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = Perkins|first = Scott, V.U.L.A.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the US [[FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles]] rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The aircraft has a standard empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

Mr Easy features a [[strut-braced]] and [[Flying wires|cable-braced]] [[biplane]] layout, a single-seat, open cockpit, fixed [[conventional landing gear]] and a single engine in [[pusher configuration]], mounted above the tail boom tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

The aircraft is made from bolted-together [[aluminum]] tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in [[Aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|24.00|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span wing has a wing area of {{convert|145.0|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The  standard engine used is the {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 447]] [[two-stroke]] twin-cylinder powerplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

Mr Easy has a typical empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|485|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|235|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

The '''Little River Turnpike Bridge''' carries [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;50]] (US&amp;nbsp;50) across the [[Little River (Goose Creek)|Little River]] near [[Aldie, Virginia|Aldie]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]. The two-arch masonry bridge was built in 1826 by the [[Little River Turnpike]] Company, which built the roadway that is now US&amp;nbsp;50. The costs of the bridge were apparently shared between that company and the Ashley's Gap Turnpike Company. It is one of a small number of masonry arch bridges still carrying a major through road in the state. It is about {{convert|108|ft|m}} long and {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/053-0244_Little_River_Turnpike_Bridge_2007_draft_Nomination.pdf|title=NRHP draft nomination for Little River Turnpike Bridge|publisher=Virginia DHR|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge has received only modest visible modifications since its construction. Concrete caps have been installed on upper surface elements, and the arch underside has also been protected with shotcrete.  The upstream central pier has had a concrete fender added to protect it from debris and scouring. The downstream parapet wall was damaged by a truck in 1998 and reconstructed, and in 2004 reinforcing metal rods were injected into the rubble of the bridge to help distribute the active load. {{As of|2014}}, the bridge has no weight limit.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt; ciao

The bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;/&gt;

'''Almoatasembellah Ali Mohamed Musrati''', known as '''Ali Musrati''' or '''Ali Al Musrati''' ({{lang-ar|المعتصم بالله علي محمد المصراتي}}; born 6 April 1996) is a Libyan [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for Portuguese club [[S.C. Braga]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Misrata]], Elmusrati began his career at [[Al-Ittihad Club (Tripoli)]]. In January 2017 he signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at [[Vitória S.C.]] of Portugal's [[Primeira Liga]], on the recommendation of their former player [[Romano Sion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andrade |first1=Tomaz |title=&quot;Al Musrati tem grande futuro, daqui a dois anos não está cá&quot;|trans-title=&quot;Al Musrati has a big future, two years from now he won't be here&quot; |url=https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/vitoria-guimaraes/noticias/li-5681099.html |accessdate=27 February 2020 |work=[[O Jogo]] |date=21 February 2017 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing for their [[Vitória S.C. B|reserve team]] in [[LigaPro]], and on 4 March 2018 scored his first goal to equalise in a 1–1 draw away to [[C.F. União]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U. Madeira-V.

On 5 August 2019, Elmusrati made his debut for the first team of the club from [[Guimarães]], playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win at [[C.D. Feirense]] in the second round of the [[Taça da Liga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=V. Guimarães elimina Feirense e está na fase de grupos da Taça da Liga|trans-title=V.

Elmusrati was loaned to [[Rio Ave F.C.]] of the same league on 29 January 2020, for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rio Ave garante empréstimo de Al Musrati |trans-title=Rio Ave secure loan of Al Musrati|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/rio-ave/detalhe/rio-ave-garante-emprestimo-de-al-musrati |accessdate=27 February 2020 |work=Record |date=29 January 2020 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, [[Diogo Figueiras]] and [[Nuno Santos (footballer, born 1995)|Nuno Santos]] were sent off on 17 June in a 2–1 home loss to [[S.L.

A young orphan gets a job working for Ramanathan ([[Major Sundarrajan]]) and quickly develops a strong attachment to his boss' daughter, Aruna ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]). Ramanathan is displeased with this and fires the young boy. Saraswathi ([[Sukumari]]) meets the young boy, adopts him and names him Raja ([[Sivaji Ganesan]]). She also happens to work for Ramanathan and Raja is thrilled to meet Aruna again. At Aruna's birthday party, he's falsely accused of theft and Saraswathi is fired from her job. She dies of a heart ailment soon after but Raja promises to look after his adopted sister Lalitha (J. Lalitha). Fifteen years later, Raja is now a rich man having amassed wealth by catching smugglers and collecting the rewards out on them. Ramanathan, on the other hand, is struggling financially. Aruna still believes that Raja is a thief and wants nothing to do with him. Heartbroken over this, Raja drinks excessively and finds solace in his friendship with dancer Kanchana ([[Sripriya]]). Aruna sees his drunken behavior as more proof of his bad character. Kanchana falls in love with Raja but realizes he will always hold a torch for Aruna. Raja meets and befriends the unemployed lawyer Ananth ([[Jaiganesh]]) and they quickly become inseperable. Ramanathan and Aruna learn that Raja has been secretly helping the family financially and grow closer to him. in light of this new closeness, Raja sets up a job for Ananth with Ramanathan. He also gains the confidence to plan to confess his love to Aruna and turns to Ananth to write the love letter as he is illiterate. Aruna misinterprets it as a love letter to her from Ananth and falls for him. Ananth, unaware of the identity of Raja's love, also falls for Aruna. Chinnadurai ([[Tiger Prabhakar]]), a criminal with a soft spot for Kanchana, hears rumors of her closeness with Raja and sets out to kill him. Lalitha's wedding is also threatened when her future in-laws learn of Raja's closeness to Kanchana. The film culminates as Raja must deal with all of his various problems at once.

''S. maculata'' is a long, slender sea cucumber with fifteen [[tentacle]]s, growing to a length of about {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MSIP/&gt; Although not the heaviest or bulkiest sea cucumber in the world, it is probably the longest, with individuals exceptionally reaching to over {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starfish, Urchins, and Other Echinoderms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lbQT4QKCH0C&amp;pg=PA40|year=2006|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7565-1611-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/natgeo/videos/10154879586498951/ |title=''Synapta maculata'' |author= |date=4 August 2017 |work=FaceBook |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its colouring is variable, being some shade of yellowish-brown with wide longitudinal stripes and patches of darker colour. The [[Sponge spicule|spicules]] (microscopic calcareous spike-like structures that support the body wall) are large and shaped like anchors and are used in locomotion; they can be as long as 2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=MSIP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=nasc&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=44&amp;tab=beschrijving |title=''Synapta maculata'' |author= Cannon, L.R.G.; Silver, H.|work=North Australian Sea Cucumbers |publisher=Marine Species Identification Portal |accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spicules are adhesive, and the sea cucumber is very difficult to detach from a [[wetsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Branch, George|author2=Griffiths, C.L.|author3=Branch, M.L.|author4=Beckley, L.E.|title=Two Oceans: A Guide to the Marine Life of Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_2QB8ftLgcC&amp;pg=PA202 |year= 2008 |publisher=Struik |isbn=978-1-77007-633-4 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to the tropical western Indo-Pacific region.&lt;ref name=WoRMS/&gt; It occurs at depths down to about {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on reefs and on soft sediments on the seabed among [[seagrass]]es and [[seaweed]]s. It can also bury itself under rubble.&lt;ref name=MSIP/&gt;

They are about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long when extended and have a short stem and a feather-like blade with thirty to forty pairs of pinnules. The outer surfaces of the tentacles have numerous bulges and are adhesive while the inner surfaces are smooth, with clusters of cilia on the proximal parts. The tentacles are in continuous motion; they flatten themselves against the substrate or seagrass leaf blades and collect food particles by adhesion, then bend inwards until the tips are in the mouth, where the food is scraped off by the buccal sphincter muscle. The whole process takes only a few seconds, and several tentacles can deliver their loads at the same time. If the animal is disturbed, the tentacles can contract back into the [[pharynx]], but before long they are out again, collecting more particles.&lt;ref name=Heinzeller&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heinzeller, Thomas |author2=Nebelsick, James H.|title=Echinoderms: Proceedings of the 11th International Echinoderm Conference, 2003, Munich, Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJZ5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-134-21879-0 |pages=327–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer surface of the tentacles bears numerous vesicular cells, and there are a few scattered vesicles on the body surface also. The function of these cells is unclear, but it is suggested that they may contain a noxious substance and serve a defensive function. The tentacles are particularly vulnerable to predation by fish, but if they taste nasty, that enables the sea cucumber to spend a greater proportion of its time feeding, rather than having to keep retracting its tentacles whenever a fish approaches.&lt;ref name=Heinzeller/&gt; There are also some cup-shaped structures on the inside of the tentacles near the stem. It is hypothesized that these are rudimentary sensory organs, able to taste the edibility of the food material that the animal is transporting to its mouth.&lt;ref name=Heinzeller/&gt;

A defensive response made by many sea cucumbers is evisceration, but in the case of ''S. maculata'', [[autotomy]] is preferred, with large individuals dispensing with sections near the rear end while smaller individuals break into many pieces.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite book|author=Jones, O.A.|title=Biology and Geology of Coral Reefs V2: Biology 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BlP_IAXGYcC&amp;pg=PA347 |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-14793-4 |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two previously unknown triterpene holostane [[glycoside]]s have been isolated from ''S. maculata''; one has moderate activity against [[HeLa]] tumour cells while the other is inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sergey A.

==In literature==
Naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]]'s 1977 observations of this creature were made when he was [[snorkeling]] in shallow water in [[Mauritius]]:

&quot;At first, I could not believe that these weird objects were alive. I thought they must be strange, dead strands of some deep-sea seaweed now washed into the shallows by the tide, to roll and undulate helplessly on the sand to the small movements of the sea. Closer inspection showed me that they were indeed alive, unlikely though it seemed. ''Sinucta muculata''{{sic}}, as this strange creature is called, is really a sort of elongated tube, which sucks in water at one end and with it microscopic organisms, and expels the water at the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Golden Bats and Pink Pigeons|author=Durrell, G.|date=2011|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=9781447214168|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ujwA74cCg7cC|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
